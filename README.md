## Abstract
In this world everyone needs a comfortable life. Our lifestyle has evolved in such a way that optimizing time is the most important thing. People need to be connected and be easily able to access the information. IoT signifies the interconnection via the internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data. The Internet of Things, with its enormous growth, widens its applications to the living environment of the people by changing a home to a smart home.

This Smart Mirror is being developed with the idea of making a home smart to save time. It will be a wall-mounted mirror that displays relevant items to the user such as weather, time, date, temperature, humidity and news, and other fields of interest.
## Implementation
We plan to use a two way see-through mirror behind which a monitor will be placed to display the relevent data. Both, the mirror and the monitor will be framed inside a steel frame. The mirror needs to be contected to the Wifi to send and recieve data. The mirror will be controlled using voice commands.
